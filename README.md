===========

The algorithm used in the machine learning exercise is the 
linear regression algorithm. Initially, I had intended to use
the polynomial interpoltion type algorithm but found it 
difficult to input data; I believed that a quadratic function 
best represents traffic status in any 24 hours of day.

Instead, using the linear algorithm, it was simple and less 
accurate.
